Visualisation, being a powerful tool to present data, has the raw power to make users understand data in a
very concise and friendly way. The visualisation of 2011 Census data in the UK helps users to learn how
the workplace population is distributed across England and Wales.

# User Education

• Workplace population distribution: The users from the map chart help the users learn how the
workplace population has been distributed. It also allows the user to get the count only for a few
cities and compare them.

• Workplace population: The map shows users which industry employs the most people. It is quite
surprising that wholesale retail is the largest employer in many local authorities. The user can easily
select a country from the filter for comparison.

• Religion: Users can use the visualisation to observe the dominant religion in the workplace.
Although the dominating is still Christian, if we remove that, then the hidden insights are uncovered.
A user can obtain information about all local governments.

• Ethnicity: This chart especially enables users to understand how diverse the workplace was back in
2011. The length of the bars helps users grasp this information easily and precisely. This can also
be seen for each local authority.

• Method of travel: Users can also observe the preferred method of travel of the people going to and
from work. The colours of the circle here show the different modes of transport an employee would
take. For easier reference, labels have been added.
